title: How to guides
---

This section goes into more detail on how to build certain aspects of your technical documentation site, including what tools you can use and recommended ways to configure those tools.

If you include this section on your site, include step-by-step guides on how to achieve certain goals with your product. Imagine that the reader is impatient and needs to get stuff done on a short timeline, so avoid adding too much context, [avoid giving them too many options](https://styleguide.ritza.co/ritza%27s-writing-rules/Style/#avoid-giving-the-reader-too-many-options), and focus on outcomes over learning.
