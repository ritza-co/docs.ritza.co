title: Product and Engineering
---

Many books have been written about product and engineering, how they can work together, and what causes the conflicts between them.

A common idea is that Product owns the 'what' and Engineering the 'how'. This is great in theory - product goes out and talks to people and figures out what they want and tells engineering. Engineering figures out what is feasible and builds a solution.

In realty, it's not that simple. 

## Who calls the shots?

You can have engineering report into product, product report into engineering, or have them as peers. If they're peers it's almost certain that one of them still holds more sway - often depending on whether the CEO or founding team comes from more of a product or engineering background.

Whether it's on the org chart or not, you probably want to explicitly acknowledge who it is.
